In the booking system, restrict branch options based on what activities are actually available at each location. For example:

Clarify where booking notifications are currently being sent (email or phone). Make sure they reach the admin/owner.

📸 CONTENT & DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS
4. Visual Flow
The homepage currently feels cluttered — simplify the layout:

Start with Activities with large clean visuals (1 image per activity)

Then list Branches, each with a neat card-style design

Add a section for Café menus and Flowers

Keep it visual, clean, and mobile-friendly

5. Menu & Flower Pricing
For X Flower, please remove all placeholder bouquets and instead:

Embed or link to @xflower_rak Instagram

Mention flower orders are accepted via WhatsApp: wa.me/971547190018
